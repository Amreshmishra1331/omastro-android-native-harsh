## [2026-10-09] — P0 Integrity Fix Pass + AI Chat (v2.0.0-hardening)

### Authentication — rebuilt on the real backend contract
**What was broken:** The app used a fake OTP-login model (demo OTP `654321`, fake JWT `demo_jwt_token`, app booted with a pre-logged-in fake user id 108). The production backend uses email+password login and emailed OTP only for signup verification — there is no SMS/WhatsApp OTP endpoint on the backend (verified against `rest-api.php`).
**Removed:** `SendOtpRequest`/`VerifyOtpRequest` OTP-login models, `fetchAuthConfig`/`sendOtp`/`verifyOtp` repository methods, demo backdoor strings, pre-logged-in fake user.
**Added:** `LoginRequest{email,password}`, `RegisterRequest{name,email,password,mobile?}`, `VerifySignupOtpRequest{email,otp}` (field corrected: `email`, not `destination`); `POST /auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/verify-signup-otp`, `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/resend-otp`; full auth UI (login, signup with validation, 6-digit OTP verify with resend cooldown, forgot password). Inline errors, loading states, zero fabricated success.

### Fabricated data — removed
**What was broken:** `AstroRepository` returned invented kundali, horoscope, panchang and milan data (`createDefault*()`) on every API failure.
**Removed:** All `createDefault*()` fallbacks.
**Added:** Honest `Result.failure` propagation on every non-2xx/exception. UI shows real error states.

### Free-money bug — closed
**What was broken:** `WalletRepository.verifyPayment` credited coins locally when verification failed, and a fake `pay_mock_`/`sig_verified` path existed.
**Removed:** `creditRecharge()`-on-failure, all mock payment strings.
**Added:** Failure now returns `Result.failure`. Real Razorpay Checkout launch (`Checkout.open()` with server order), real verify with payment signature.

### Endpoints — remapped to real routes
**What was broken:** 10 declared endpoints returned 404 (`horoscope/daily` GET, `panchang` GET, `matchmaking`, `chat/*`, `wallet/balance`, `wallet/order`, `wallet/verify`, `auth/config`, `auth/send-otp`).
**Removed:** `auth/config`, `auth/send-otp` declarations.
**Added:** `POST /rashifal`, `POST /panchang`, `POST /matching`, `GET /astrologers/chat/history`, `POST /astrologers/chat/open|close`, `GET /wallet/transactions`, `POST /wallet/topup-order|verify`, `POST /astrologers/session/start|tick|end`, `POST /numerology`, `POST /kundali/bnn`, `POST /astro-health`, `POST /ai/chat`.

### Security hardening
**Removed:** `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`; unconditional HTTP BODY logging; in-memory-only token storage; `google-services.json` committed to git (now gitignored; CI injects it; plugin applies conditionally).
**Added:** BODY logging gated behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG`; `EncryptedSharedPreferences` token store (survives process death; `security-crypto` dependency added); README documents CI secret injection.

### Kundali — real user data
**What was broken:** Hardcoded "Arjun Sharma" birth data; decorative South-Indian button; bogus D9 +4° offset.
**Removed:** Hardcoded fetch, fake South-Indian button, invented D9 offset.
**Added:** Birth-input form (name, date, time, place, lat/lon) as entry point; real `SouthIndianChart.kt` (fixed-sign 4x4 grid, planets by true sign, ascendant marker); divisionals render only API-returned data.

### Numerology / AstroHealth — real backends
**What was broken:** Hardcoded mulank=6, hardcoded organ list, "84% vitality".
**Removed:** All hardcoded values.
**Added:** `NumerologyViewModel` → `POST /numerology`; `AstroHealthViewModel` → `POST /astro-health` via `AstroRepository`; loading/error/empty states; medical disclaimer.

### Astrologer consultation — real billing + real messaging
**What was broken:** Keyword-bot fake chat replies; timer deducted coins locally with no server call.
**Removed:** Keyword responder, local coin deduction.
**Added:** Real session billing (`session/start` → `tick` every 60s → `end`); real messaging via `POST /ai/chat` (same mechanism as the website's astrologer chat); honest session UI with timer and End Consultation.

### AI Chat — new feature
**What was missing:** No AI chat existed in the native app.
**Added:** `AiChatScreen` + `AiChatViewModel` + `ChatRepository`; 3 modes (General / Divine / Mundane) with separate sessions; `POST /ai/chat`; typing indicator, auto-scroll, error handling, empty states; bottom-nav entry.

### UI polish
**Removed:** All pictographic emojis from UI strings (🪙🧘🕉️🙏🌅🌇🌙). Professional jyotish glyphs (♈☉♂) retained as standard notation.
**Added:** Material icons replacements; ~50 professional string resources.

### CI
**Added:** `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` (JDK 17, assembleDebug, APK artifact); google-services plugin applies only when `google-services.json` exists.

### Not removed (verified present)
- In-app review: `RequestInAppReviewUseCase` (Google Play `review-ktx`) — intact, never removed.
- FCM push: `OmAstroFirebaseMessagingService` + `POST /auth/fcm-token` — intact.

### Notes
- SMS/WhatsApp OTP for login was never a real backend feature; the app contained only a local simulation. Not re-added as "real" because no such backend endpoint exists. Email+password + emailed signup OTP is the real contract.
- No WhatsApp/email marketing campaign endpoint exists on the backend; nothing was removed from the app in this area.
